# <Homework - Week 1>
## Description
This is my attempt at the first homework assignment for the UCSD coding bootcamp. I used several resources that have been made available to our class including sites and references for semantic format in html and how to consolidate lines of code in css. The problem was changing <div> tags into appropriate semantic format, increasing the site's accessability score by adjusting color and adding alt text to certain elements, and to make sure that the links were working properly in the navigation bar. The most challenging part of this assignment was me working against my anxiety to delete existing code to consolidate different images/elements into a single class that would apply a single set of measurements, color, and other features to clean up the code. I learned to stop doubting myself since I am new and need to push outside of my comfort zone to learn in this course, and to collaborate with my classmates to come up with answers to problems and help others where I can. I learned a lot in this lesson, and I can't wait to learn more.
## Installation
Visual Studio Code.
## Usage
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
## Features
If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
## How to Contribute
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
