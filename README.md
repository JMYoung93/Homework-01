# <Homework - Week 1>
## Description
This is my attempt at the first homework assignment for the UCSD coding bootcamp. I used several resources that have been made available to our class including sites and references for semantic format in html and how to consolidate lines of code in css. The problem was changing <div> tags into appropriate semantic format, increasing the site's accessability score by adjusting color and adding alt text to certain elements, and to make sure that the links were working properly in the navigation bar. The most challenging part of this assignment was me working against my anxiety to delete existing code to consolidate different images/elements into a single class that would apply a single set of measurements, color, and other features to clean up the code. I learned to stop doubting myself since I am new and need to push outside of my comfort zone to learn in this course, and to collaborate with my classmates to come up with answers to problems and help others where I can. I learned a lot in this lesson, and I can't wait to learn more.
